# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn, utilizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify customers at risk of leaving a business. The model was trained on historical customer data, including factors like demographics, service usage patterns, and customer feedback. Key tasks involved data preprocessing, feature selection, model architecture design, and hyperparameter tuning. By evaluating the model's performance with accuracy, precision, and recall, I was able to achieve a reliable prediction rate, which can help businesses improve customer retention strategies by identifying high-risk customers early.
